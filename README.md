# CISA KEV Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive modeling pipeline to identify CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that are likely to become CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs).

## üîç Problem Statement

Organizations face overwhelming numbers of reported software vulnerabilities. Only a few are actively exploited. The goal of this project is to predict which CVEs will be labeled as KEVs using machine learning models and multi-source feature integration (CVSS, EPSS, CPE).

## üß† Methodology

- **Data Source**: Aggregated datasets from Kaggle combining CVE, KEV, CVSS, EPSS, and CPE data.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Feature encoding (one-hot, factor conversion)
  - SMOTE (oversampling) and undersampling with PCA
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost (baseline, threshold-tuned, and cost-sensitive)

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- AUC (Area Under Curve)
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Cost-sensitive XGBoost achieved the best performance:
- AUC: 0.9957
- Recall: 1.00
- Precision: 0.907
- F1 Score: ~0.95
